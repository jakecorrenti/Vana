# Vana

Have a bad habit that you would love to break? Meet, Vana! Vana allows you to break down your habits, turn them into good ones, and track your results along the way!

Here is how Vana works: 
1. Figure out the habit that you want to break 
2. Break your habit down into hte three main parts: the Cue, Routine, and Reward
3. Create a new routine that will be triggered by the same Cue and give you the same Reward 
4. Track how much of your new routine you are able to complete, and track your progress as you go by keeping a streak!
5. Determine whether or not you have "completed" transforming your bad habit into a new one

You may keep track of as many habits as you would like. The goal of Vana is to allow you to realize what makes your bad habit, and realize how to change it so that you can make a positive change in your everyday life.
